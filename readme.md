## Activity 6
The new styled UI is much more usable primarily in the way that it presents text in the search result table. Previously, there was a lot of text in the table rows, and rows were not clearly/visually distinct. So, it could be confusing reading about all the courses in the table. The row separation via borders and padding makes the presented information a lot easier to digest. I'm not a fan of the wonky color scheme, but that's a minor detail. Overall, styled UI is much more presentable and easy to use for a user.
